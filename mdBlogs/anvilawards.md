    Prometheus, the only award-winning and full-service marketing agency in Western Visayas, wins two prestigious accolades at the 60th Anvil Awards. The agency was honored for its exceptional work on Daily Guardian’s 22nd Anniversary campaign, “Ilonggo Stories That Continue With You”, earning a Silver Anvil Award for ‘Best Public Relations-Led Integrated Campaign’ and another Silver Anvil Award for ‘Public Relations Tools – Special Events’.
    </br>
    The campaign, which celebrated Daily Guardian’s legacy as a trusted regional news brand, featured innovative ‘markers’ placed at locations in Iloilo where significant news stories had occurred, significantly boosting Daily Guardian’s online impressions and solidifying its connection with the Ilonggo community.

Prometheus stands out as the only agency outside Metro Manila to collaborate with a regional brand to be selected for an Anvil Award. Competing against numerous international and national nominees, the agency’s achievement highlights its ability to deliver world-class marketing and PR solutions that resonate deeply with local audiences.
    </br>

The Anvil Awards, presented by the Public Relations Society of the Philippines (PRSP), is the most prestigious recognition for outstanding public relations programs and tools in the country. Prometheus’s double win highlights and proves its commitment to innovation, creativity, and excellence in the field of marketing and public relations.
    </br>

“It is an unbelievable honor to be recognized at the Anvil Awards,” said Francis Gino Fanega, Executive Creative Director of Prometheus. “It’s payoff for our team’s dedication and creative ability for storytelling and meaningful relations with communities. Working with Daily Guardian on this campaign was a privilege, and we are so grateful to see our efforts recognized at such a prestigious stage.”
    </br>

As Prometheus continues to raise the bar for marketing excellence in Western Visayas and beyond, this recognition stands testament to the power and value of effective communication and significant connection with individuals and their communities.
